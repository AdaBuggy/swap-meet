# Swap Meet: Buggy Edition!

## Bug Lowdown

There are two bugs in this code. One bug causes one test to fail, the other causes two tests to fail. 

The objective is to use your debugging skills to _understand_ **what** the program is doing wrong and **why**. At the end of the day, the easiest (and quite possibly best) way to fix the bugs would be to just copy/paste your to the buggy functions to replace this solution, so the emphasis here is **less on fixin**g the bug and **more on understanding**.

Have fun!
